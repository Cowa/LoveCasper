# Love Casper
> A small, clean &amp; ligthweight ***kind of*** reimplementation of Casper project

The original project was made in C++ and Qt and can be found [here](https://github.com/Matthieu-Riou/Casper).
But because of C++ and Qt, it was quite big, heavy, painfully deployable and less fun !

This reimplementation is made in **Lua** with the **LÃ¶ve** framework.

Its goal is to be easy, fun and *super* fast to tweak.

## How to launch ?

Inside the repository :

`love .`

That's all !
